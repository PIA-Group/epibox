# ****************************** MAIN SCRIPT ***********************************
# This is the main script. It is lauched by EpiBOX Core, through the epibox_startup.sh Bash script.

# This script attempts to connect to the default biosignal acquisition devices in a continuous loop.
# The loop stops only if:
#       - connection is successful
#       - timeout is achieved (2min)

# If timeout, the script ends (being later lauched again by EpiBOX Core)
# If connection is successful, acquisition starts and PyEpiBOX receives and handles data from the
# acquisition devices.
# The loop stops only if:
#       - user stops the acquisition
#       - at least one of the devices disconnects
